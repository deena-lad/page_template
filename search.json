    "text": "I am a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Engineering from Ajeenkya DY Patil University, where I completed my degree with a GPA of 9.41/10. Currently, I’m a Research Intern at the Sustainability Lab, IIT Gandhinagar, where I’m applying artificial intelligence to healthcare — specifically, building vision-based systems for sleep apnea detection using thermal imagery alone, without relying on wearable sensors.\n\n\nMy technical strengths lie in machine learning, computer vision, NLP, and large language models. I enjoy designing end-to-end ML pipelines and have worked extensively with frameworks like TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, and YOLO architectures. I’m deeply motivated by research that blends practical impact with technical rigor, and I aspire to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science to further explore AI for real-world challenges.\n\n\nOutside of academics, I am a chess player with a peak Chess.com rapid rating of 1890."
